# GWAS-overlap

What is a GWAS 'signal'?

- A **causal variant** increases risk of disease.
- A GWAS (**G**enome **W**ide **A**ssociation **S**tudy) will observe this SNP at a higher frequency in a cohort of cases, compared to controls. 
- Due to haplotype structure, all SNPs in high LD with the causal SNP are also present at a higher frequency in cases.
- All of the variants on the same **haplotype** as the causal SNP will therefore be observed to be *significantly associated* with disease.
- This set of associated SNPs makes up a GWAS 'signal' 

A GWAS **signal** is therefore hypothesised to "capture" or "result from" just **one causal variant**. However, the observed results will consist of a set of associated SNPs in high LD, one of which should be the causal variant.

### Combining GWAS 

- Two independent GWAS may observe significant association resulting from the same causal variant. They therefore observe the same "signal". 
- GWAS reports label each "signal" using one unique identifier, typically the **lead SNP**.
- The **lead SNP** is simply the SNP which, in that study, had the smallest p-value.
- While the causal variant remains the same, two different GWAS may report two different **lead SNPs**. 

This can be due to technical variations in e.g. missing data, imputation quality, random fluctuations, LD structure. At a signal where SNPs are in complete LD (and therefore have the same level of association), small differences in the thousands of samples can be enough to make one SNP *slightly* more significant than another. These variations are random and therefore the lead SNP can differ between studies. 

### Credible sets vs expanded SNPs 

Depending on the GWAS, either the lead SNP or credible sets may be provided.

Independent GWAS which capture the SAME SIGNAL (i.e. an association caused by the same causal variant) may have different lead SNPs, as described above. These lead SNPs will be in *high LD*. See the example below, where the image shows a haplotype of high LD.

The complete 'signal' of association from each GWAS will consist of the credible set, or the expanded set of SNPs. Two GWAS which capture the same causal variant will have an *almost* identical list of SNPs making up the "signal". However, there might be one or two SNPs included in one GWAS and not the other. This may be, for example, if there are several SNPs in high LD (r^2 > 0.8) with the GWAS 1 lead SNP, which do not reach the LD threshold for GWAS 2 lead SNP. In the example below, both GWAS 1 and GWAS 2 capture 2 SNPs in the expanded SNPs which were not captured by the other.

In this example, we can see several duplicated SNPs. E.g. rs132641 is present twice with two lead SNPs (rs132665 and rs132662). These two lead SNPs must therefore be labelling the same signal from two indpendent GWAS.

To combine the data for this signal, we want to have:

1. the 'expanded' SNPs for this signal, which will consist of the merged lists of expanded SNPs from both studies (we expect this list to be almost identical, since the two lead SNPs will be in high LD, but there may be a couple of SNPs captured in only study as different lead SNPs were expanded).
2. **ONE** unique identifier to 'label' this signal. We will use one of the two lead SNPs (we will arbitrarily take the first one from the list).
