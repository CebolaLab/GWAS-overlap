What is a GWAS 'signal'?

- A **causal variant** increases risk of disease.
- A GWAS (**G**enome **W**ide **A**ssociation **S**tudy) will observe this SNP at a higher frequency in a cohort of cases, compared to controls. 
- Due to haplotype structure, all SNPs in high LD with the causal SNP are also present at a higher frequency in cases.
- All of the variants on the same **haplotype** as the causal SNP will therefore be observed to be *significantly associated* with disease.
- This set of associated SNPs makes up a GWAS 'signal' 

A GWAS **signal** is therefore hypothesised to capture just one **causal variant**. However, the observed results will consist of a set of associated SNPs in high LD, one of which should be the causal variant.
