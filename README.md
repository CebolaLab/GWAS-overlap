What is a GWAS 'signal'?

- A **causal variant** increases risk of disease.
- A GWAS (**G**enome **W**ide **A**ssociation **S**tudy) will *observe* this SNP at a higher frequency in a cohort of cases, compared to controls. 
- Due to haplotype structure, the GWAS will *also observe all SNPs in high LD with the causal SNP at a higher frequency in cases*.
- All of the variants on the same **haplotype** as the causal SNP will therefore be observed to be *significantly associated* with disease.
- This set of associated SNPs makes up the GWAS 'signal'
